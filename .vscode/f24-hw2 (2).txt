Homework 2

a. use a font from https://fonts.google.com/ 
2. Create a html file with a flex container and three flex items. Give the flex items a color and width/height of 100px. For screens <500px wide have the items flow vertically and >= 500px flow horizontally. 
3. Compare and contrast Flexbox and CSS grid, how are they alike and how are they different?
Flexbox is different from the CSS  grid because flexbox assigns the values to the items in the CSS grid. A flex box is one dimensional in layout. While CSS grids have rows and columns. 

4. Create an html file with bootstrap 4 included via a cdn link(there is an example in the lecture code). Access the nav bar component documentation at 
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/navbar/. Copy the html code of one of the types of navbars listed on the documentation, it should be wrapped in a nav element. Copy and paste the html code into your page and replace the “Navbar” content with your name, it should be in an anchor tag with the “navbar-brand” class.
